Members: Vy Le, Tristan Neate, Spencer Holm, Oliver Larsson, Alexander Wilson, Ryan Murphy

Project description: Designed for winter sports enthusiasts who wish to safely take part in their sport in the backcountry, SnowSafe uses crowdsourced data to give users a more complete picture on snow safety. Log in, record data about snow at your location, and look up what others have recorded to see if an area is safe. 

Organization/Structure: 
  - The milestones are in the "Milestones" folder.
  - Everything related to our actual project, like the HTML, CSS, and JS files, are in the "Project" folder. 
  - Test cases using the Selenium IDE are in the file "testsFinal.side". In order to run the test case scripts in GitHub, you need to have the Selenium IDE extension on your browser: https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/
 Once opened in browser: 
 Open Project (folder in top-right) > Unit Tests > testsFinal.side
 To play tests, click play icon at top 
 To view raw scripts: File > Open File > Unit Tests > testsFinal.side
