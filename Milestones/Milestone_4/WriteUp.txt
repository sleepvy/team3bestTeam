Milestone 4

We are using a NOSQL database, please see "SampleDatabase.png" for our current database model.

We contacted Professor Alan and discussed the use of a NOSQL backend and recieved permision under the conditions that all of us worked with the backend, not just the person who is familiar with it.

As such we do not have SQl scripts to submit. All of our communication with the database is through javascript.
A sample database read takes the form of:
database().ref("users/<user_Id>/Name").once('value', function(snapshot){
    if(snapshot.exists()){
        console.log(snapshot.value());
    }else{
        console.log("value does not exist");
    }
});
