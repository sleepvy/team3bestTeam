1. What have you completed since the last meeting?
We set up our Github and Trello, along with our Firebase account. Everyone got familiar with Firebase. We outlined our website.

2. What will you complete before the next meeting?
Tristan will finish the firebase skeleton file, this will allow the rest of the group to start work and not get hung up on the setup. We will read some more Firebase documentation and make sure everyone is familiar with Github and Trello. We will also complete Milestone 3. 

3. Describe any obstacles or roadblocks you face. 
An obstacle is getting adequate with both Firebase and Github. Deciding on a suitable web host.

Retrospective:

	So far work and collaboration has gone smoothly, we have a good setup to get started and split up the work. Only area of improvement would be communicating meeting absences.
