  2. Open the Selenium IDE extension. 
  3. In the app, find the folder "open" icon, and open the script in this folder. 
  4. Run any of the tests on the left with the "play" icon on the top of the page. 
  5. To create new tests, click the red "record" icon in the top-right and navigate the SnowSafe page in the way that you want the test to replicate. 
  
Note: To continually test the login page, you'll have to clear your history and reload the page, since once logged in you cannot access that page again.
